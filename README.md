> It's been a very long time since I've been able to have any time to update it, and I probably won't get time to give it what it deserves. I made this before I was an iOS developer. Honestly, the best thing would be to re-create it from scratch, possibly with an auto-updating catalogue of markers.

Victorian Emergency Markers
=========

Emergency Markers are dotted throughout Victoria. These markers help the emergency services find places that have no fixed address, such as parks and trails. The Victorian Emergency Services Telecommunications Authority (ESTA) maintains a database of their locations. Crucially, this database includes detailed instructions on the best way to get an emergency vehicle to the marker. ESTA makes this database available on https://data.gov.au. This is that database in iOS App form.

For more about emergency markers, please see ESTA's own website: https://www.esta.vic.gov.au/emergency-markers

To get the dataset yourself, please see: https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-dga-77ec8fb6-ccee-4937-a266-9706899d78f9/distribution/dist-dga-6d8dbef4-1f0b-46f8-b2e9-eb894ba6f138/details?q=emergency%20marker

From time-to-time, I update the data set. Soon, we will implement automatic updating...
