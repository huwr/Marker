Victorian Emergency Markers
=========

Emergency Markers are dotted throughout Victoria. These markers help the emergency services find places that have no fixed address, such as parks and trails. The Victorian Emergency Services Telecommunications Authority (ESTA) maintains a database of their locations. Crucially, this database includes detailed instructions on the best way to get an emergency vehicle to the marker. ESTA makes this database available on https://data.gov.au. This is that database in iOS App form.

For more about emergency markers, please see ESTA's own website: https://www.esta.vic.gov.au/emergency-markers

From time-to-time, I update the data set. Soon, we will implement automatic updating...
